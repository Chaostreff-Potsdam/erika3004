Or follow the steps described in our wiki page:

## Assuming your hardware is working ...

You should be able to run:

```
./erika_print < example/fox.txt
```

Which should print the contents of `example/fox.txt`:

> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Did it work?
Congrats your Erika-Setup seems to be working just fine.

You could also try printing this file and see what happens...
